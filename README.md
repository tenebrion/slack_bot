# slack_bot
Chat bot for slack

The main program is run through bot.py

This is a personl challenge for myself that I saw on /r/learningpython. What started as a simple bot, turned into working with different APIs, adding features, working with json and xml, among many other things. The bot connects to my personal slack channel and I don't keep it running all the time. Although I could and did from my RaspberryPi.

I store all my API keys in a seperate TinyDB file that I query when a function is called.

I'm continually tweaking the formatting / layout as I learn new techniques. For example, in the bot.py file (which is the main file), I setup the list of actions in a dictionary with the value set to the method call.
